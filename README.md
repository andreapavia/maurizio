# Maurizio: The stupid, amateur design system.

A simple design system implementation and landing page used as POC to apply concept from a UI design course.

This is my very first attempt at learning something that interested me over my whole web developement career: UI/UX design.
All the content and visual matrerial was (probably poorly, but it is what it is) designed by me (@andreapavia).
